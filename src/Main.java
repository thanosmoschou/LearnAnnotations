  		/* From the official Java documentation:
		 * public final class Class<T> 
		 * extends Object 
		 * implements Serializable, GenericDeclaration, Type, AnnotatedElement
		 * 
		 * Type Parameters:
		 * T - the type of the class modeled by this Class object. For example, the type of String.class is Class<String>. Use Class<?> if the class being modeled is unknown.
		 * 
		 * Instances of the class Class represent classes and interfaces in a running Java application. 
		 * An enum is a kind of class and an annotation is a kind of interface. 
		 * Every array also belongs to a class that is reflected as a Class object that is shared by all arrays with the same element type and number of dimensions. 
		 * The primitive Java types (boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double), and the keyword void are also represented as Class objects.
		 * 
		 * Class has no public constructor. Instead Class objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes are loaded and by calls to the defineClass method in the class loader.
		 * 
		 * The following example uses a Class object to print the class name of an object:
		 * 
		 * void printClassName(Object obj) 
		 * {
		 *     System.out.println("The class of " + obj +
		 *     " is " + obj.getClass().getName());
		 * }
		 * 
		 * It is also possible to get the Class object for a named type (or for void) using a class literal. See Section 15.8.2 of The Javaâ„¢ Language Specification. For example:
		 * 
		 * System.out.println("The name of class Foo is: " + Foo.class.getName());
